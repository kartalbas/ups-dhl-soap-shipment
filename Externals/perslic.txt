Personal license key: 7ln/D

Before redistributing your application, make sure to set your personal license key using LlSetOptionString (hJob, LL_OPTIONSTR_LICENSINGINFO, "<license key>") in order to avoid error messages from the redistributed application. The .NET, VCL and OCX components offer a property "LicensingInfo" for this purpose. Use a call similar to LL.LicensingInfo="<license key>" to set your license key there.
